# Untitled Game Idea for Godot Wild Jam

To be decided...

## Pre-requisites

- Git-LFS (https://git-lfs.github.com)
- Godot 4.1 (https://godotengine.org/download)
- Code editor (Godot, JetBrains, VSCode, etc.)

## Development

Make sure you have GIT-LFS installed and enabled before cloning the repository.
Once you clone, it should automatically download the large files and setup the
git hooks for it.

Once cloned, run `./setup.sh` in a bash terminal to setup the project that will
add hooks to update the `git_info.gd` which is used to display the current 
version in the game.
